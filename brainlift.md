# Brainlift: AI-Powered Task Management Systems

## What's the Core Problem?

### What specific challenge are you trying to solve?

There are a million "todo/task management systems", and a million apps to help you follow those systems, but I've never found a good one that works for me. It's just too much effort to keep manual track of everything on my todo list and to prioritise them. But at the same time, I do acutely feel the need for some kind of app or system - I end up organising myself through disjointed ad hoc systems that are better than nothing but still disorganised and not great.

The conflict has always between finding a system that's *powerful* - allows me to keep track of everything and stay on top of it - but *minimal friction*; managing my task list should be effortless so I can dedicate maximum time and energy to, y'know, actually doing the tasks. And I think with AI, such a system is finally possible.

### Why is this important right now?

There's already a proliferation of todo apps on the market. But the fact that there are so many, and that people *still* keeping releasing new ones, shows that this is still an unsolved problem.

Something like my idea wouldn't have been possible before AI reached its current state. But now with LLMs offering advanced natural language processing, exciting new things are possible.

### What's the current impact of this problem?

- Constant wasted effort and energy trying to keep track of everything on my to-do list.
- Suboptimal productivity as I forget things or work on the wrong thing.

## What's Your Target Outcome?

### What does success look like?

My ultimate vision (probably too much for one week) is to have an AI that functions like a human personal assistant - albeit a human with infinite patience and an infallible memory. I want the AI to be like a personal manager: I 

The perfect system will:

- Fully understand everything I say in chat and extract my intents to update the task list + schedule.
- Reduce 
- Maintains perfect recall without requiring manual organization

### Who benefits from solving this?

Anyone who needs to manage a busy schedule. That's most people in adult life, especially professionals! But mostly it benefits me as I've had this idea for a long time, so I thank Gauntlet for giving me the excuse to finally have a go at it.

## Define Clear Boundaries

### What's included in the scope?

- Natural language task creation and management
- Visual calendar integration with drag-and-drop
- Event-driven architecture that allows full undo/redo. This simplifies the integration with the chat as the chat only has to trigger the same events that the user can manually trigger in the other UI.

### What's explicitly excluded?

- Voice chat (definitely an important feature but too much for the available time .)
- Team features. This is for a single user for now. (A commercial product would very probably need to add team features as that's where the money is.)
- Sync with external calendar (nice-to-have but not essential for v1)
- Mobile/web versions (I'll validate the idea on desktop then it can be taken to other platforms with a web backend to sync data.)

### What adjacent problems won't you tackle?

- Habit tracking (maybe one day but there are already lots of existing apps for this and it's not central to my idea.)
- Note-taking and knowledge management
- Meeting scheduling (this app has calendar-like features but it's not a calendar app.)
- Pomodoro or other productivity methodologies
